# Project Cortex

This repository is built on a structured template designed specifically for long-term, AI-assisted development. It enforces a strict dual-folder workspace to prevent AI agents from losing context or generating disorganized file structures over time.

## How to Use This Template

Whenever you start a new conversation with an AI agent in this repository, you **must** prime it with the system rules.

Copy and paste this exact prompt as your first message to the AI:

> **System Prompt Override:** You are operating in Project Cortex. Before doing anything else, you must read the AI-only documentation in `memory/README.md`, `memory/constraints/README.md`, and `code/README.md`. Strictly adhere to the nested calendar memory architecture and all system constraints defined in those files.

When you finish your current session with an agent, tell it "that's it for today" (or something similar). This triggers the agent to summarize the conversation and create a log file in the `memory/` directory.

## Project Structure

- `code/`: The shared workspace where development happens. 
- `memory/`: Auto-managed storage where the AI synthesizes and archives conversation logs to maintain context over months or years.

---
*Note: The `README.md` files located inside `code/` and `memory/` are system instructions written exclusively for the AI. You do not need to read them unless you want to modify how the AI behaves.*
